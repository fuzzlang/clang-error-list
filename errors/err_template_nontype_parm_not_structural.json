  "description": "This error occurs when a non-type template parameter has a type that is not allowed for non-type template parameters. In C++20, only structural types are allowed.",
  "exampleCode": "struct RRef {\n  int &&r; // cxx20-note 1+{{'RRef' is not a structural type because it has a non-static data member of rvalue reference type}}\n};\n\ntemplate<RRef> struct WithRRef {};",
  "explanation": "The error occurs because RRef contains an rvalue reference member, which makes it a non-structural type. In C++20, only structural types are allowed as non-type template parameters. A type with rvalue reference members cannot be used as a non-type template parameter.",
  "fixedCode": "struct RRef {\n  int &&r; // cxx20-note 1+{{'RRef' is not a structural type because it has a non-static data member of rvalue reference type}}\n};\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nstruct WithRRef {};"
